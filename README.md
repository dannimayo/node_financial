Frameworks are now available for pretty much all development environments. Explain the value of a framework like Sails.js. What are the positive aspects, and what are the negative aspects of a framework?
  Frameworks like Sails.js make development much easier in all aspects, you save time and trouble by using what's already out there. You   also save  by using code that's more widely used. As a developer, you end up focusing on the more nitty gritty of what you want your app has to do instead of setting up the infrastructure (plumbing).

What applications could benefit from using a framework?
  I believe that applications with very generic functionality benefit the most from using frameworks. Applications that do not delve into too custom of workings and are not super small fitted.

Describe an application where a framework may not be appropriate.
  A small application doing very specific things may not need a framework. I believe a simple application just displaying general information and not taking client data or action doesn't need a framework.

Describe 3 things you learned from this assignment.
  1. I learned quite a bit on node.js. I have definitely brushed up on my html and css as well. In general, my development has been dusted off a bit.
  2. I learned about the MVC framework in a very handson manner. I believe that this was extremely beneficial. Making an application that utilizes the framework
      instead of just reading about it and never applying it was a pro.
  3. I learned abit about using public deployment, more specifically Openshift. I learned alot about reading up on the port8080 error and other sites
      that are also used for deployment. Google was very helpful.


How could this assignment be improved?

  I feel like this assignment was very rushed, beneficial but very rushed. I feel like I already had some footing on development but I know that there were many others that
  did not & were too caught up in getting things to just 'work' instead of focusing on learning objectives.
